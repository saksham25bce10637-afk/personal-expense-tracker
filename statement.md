1. Problem Statement
Many individuals lack immediate visibility into their spending habits, relying on fragmented systems or manual spreadsheets which are prone to errors and do not
offer timely analytical summaries. This lack of clear, actionable insight into where money is being spent makes budgeting and financial planning difficult, often
leading to budget overruns and missed savings opportunities. A simple, persistent, and accessible tool is required to streamline the logging and visualization
of daily expenses.


3. Scope of the Project
The project encompasses the development of a stand-alone, single-user Command-Line Interface (CLI) application for managing personal expenditures.
The core activities within scope include:
Establishing a persistent data storage mechanism using an embedded SQLite database.
Developing input validation logic for expense entry.
Implementing aggregation and reporting functionality using Pandas.
Generating a single data visualization (Pie Chart) of category spending using Matplotlib.
Providing a menu-driven interface for all user interactions.
The following features are explicitly out of scope for the current version: web interface, cloud synchronization, multi-user support, advanced filtering
(beyond category/date range), integration with external banking APIs, or export capabilities (e.g., CSV/JSON).
